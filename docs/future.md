# Xedra Linux - Future Ideas & Optimization Roadmap

This document serves as a parking lot and architectural backlog for future optimizations, tooling enhancements, and features to be evaluated in upcoming milestones.

---

## 1. Build Pipeline & Performance Optimizations

### 1.1 Stage-by-Stage Stopwatch Instrumentation
* **Concept**: Refactor `scripts/build-iso.sh` to invoke `live-build`'s discrete sub-stages (`lb bootstrap`, `lb chroot`, `lb binary`) rather than a single opaque `lb build` call.
* **Goal**: Measure and print exact elapsed wall-clock seconds for each sub-stage to output a structured benchmark summary at the end of every compilation.
* **Target Milestone**: Future tooling refresh.

### 1.2 RAM-Disk (`tmpfs`) Chroot Workspace
* **Concept**: Mount a temporary memory-backed filesystem (`tmpfs`) at `~/XedraLinux/build/live-build/chroot/` before `lb chroot` package extraction begins.
* **Benefit**: Eliminates virtualized storage latency and host journal write barriers, allowing `dpkg` package extraction to operate at memory bus bandwidth (~10–15 GB/s).
* **Considerations**: Requires ensuring adequate RAM allocation on the builder VM (e.g. 6–8 GB RAM allocated to `xedra-builder`).

### 1.3 Debian Build-Time Trigger Deferral
* **Concept**: Suppress redundant background indexing and regeneration tasks during live image generation:
  * **`man-db` auto-update**: Disable via debconf during build (`man-db man-db/auto-update boolean false`).
  * **`update-initramfs`**: Defer kernel initramfs regeneration during individual package unpacks and execute it exactly once during final chroot assembly.

### 1.4 Multi-Threaded Compression Algorithms (`zstd` vs. `gzip`)
* **Concept**: Systematically benchmark `zstd -1` against `gzip -1` for live SquashFS generation.
* **Metrics to evaluate**:
  1. Build-time compression throughput (seconds to compress 1.5 GB rootfs across 2–4 CPU cores).
  2. Boot-time decompression latency inside disposable test VMs (`xedra-lab`).
  3. Resulting ISO image size.

### 1.5 SysVinit Transition Hook Package Ordering Refactor
* **Observation**: In `0100-sysvinit-transition.hook.chroot`, installing `sysvinit-core`, `initscripts`, and `insserv` in a single batch `apt-get install` occasionally causes `insserv`'s postinst trigger to run before `initscripts` is configured, producing a transient warning (`insserv: FATAL: service mountkernfs has to exist for service networking`).
* **Solution**: Refactor the hook into discrete stages:
  1. Install `initscripts` and `orphan-sysvinit-scripts` first (creating `/etc/init.d/mountkernfs.sh`, `/etc/init.d/urandom`, and LSB facility definitions).
  2. Install `sysvinit-core`, `insserv`, `live-config-sysvinit`, and `elogind`.
  3. Explicitly execute `insserv -d` to recalculate the complete dependency boot sequence across all runlevel scripts.

## 2. Shell & Developer CLI Enhancements

### 2.1 Automated Zoxide Shell Integration (`z` Jump Command)
* **Concept**: Inject `eval "$(zoxide init bash)"` into `/etc/bash.bashrc` (or `/home/live/.bashrc` via skeleton overlay).
* **Benefit**: Enables the interactive `z <directory>` fuzzy directory jump command out of the box without requiring manual user shell setup.

---

## 3. Desktop & Installer Enhancements

### 3.1 Graphical Installer (Calamares Integration)
* **Concept**: Integrate the modular Qt-based Calamares installer alongside the existing native `/usr/local/bin/xedra-installer`.
* **Features**: Visual disk partitioner, timezone map selector, and locale configuration.

### 3.2 Dedicated Package Repository (APT Mirror)
* **Concept**: Host a standalone Xedra package repository (`deb.xedralinux.org` / GitHub Pages raw pool) for distribution-specific packages, themes, and customized SysVinit scripts.

### 3.3 Automated Builder VM Resource Tuning
* **Concept**: Provide a host helper script to dynamically scale `xedra-builder`'s CPU core and RAM allocation based on host hardware availability before launching heavy release builds.
