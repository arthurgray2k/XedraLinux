# Architectural Decision Records (ADR)

This document records the foundational technical decisions for Xedra Linux, explaining the rationale, alternatives considered, and why each choice was made.

---

## 1. Upstream Base: Debian 13 "Trixie" (amd64)

- **Decision**: Build Xedra directly on top of Debian 13 "Trixie" stable repositories without custom package forks.
- **Reason**: Debian provides the largest, most stable collection of pre-compiled packages with transparent packaging standards and robust dependency tracking. Using Debian Stable guarantees reliability and avoids the burden of maintaining thousands of package builds.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - *Arch Linux*: Rolling release base; too volatile for a stable educational baseline.
  - *Alpine Linux*: Musl-based; highly minimalist, but incompatible with standard glibc Debian packages and standard SysVinit patterns.
  - *From Scratch (LFS)*: Compiling everything from source; over-engineers the build system and obscures package management concepts.
- **Verdict**: **Debian 13 Trixie** provides the ideal balance of stability, package availability, and transparency.

## 2. Init System: SysVinit as PID 1

- **Decision**: Enforce SysVinit (`sysvinit-core`) as PID 1. Strictly exclude `systemd-sysv`.
- **Reason**: Educational clarity. SysVinit operates via clear shell scripts in `/etc/init.d/` and predictable runlevel symlinks in `/etc/rc*.d/`. Every service start and shutdown can be inspected, traced, and understood line-by-line without binary loggers or opaque service managers.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - *systemd*: Default Debian init system; powerful but introduces high complexity, tight subsystem coupling, binary journals, and opaque state management.
  - *OpenRC / Runit*: Excellent lightweight init systems, but SysVinit is the classic Unix init standard natively supported in Debian repositories via `sysvinit-core`.
- **Verdict**: **SysVinit** maximizes transparency and learning value.

## 3. Display Server: X11 with XLibre-Compatible Design

- **Decision**: Use the X11 display stack for initial graphical output, structured to permit a future migration to XLibre.
- **Reason**: X11 is mature, well-documented, runs on minimal resources without requiring Wayland compositor abstractions, and integrates directly with lightweight window managers like Fluxbox.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - *Wayland*: Modern display protocol, but requires a complex compositor (e.g. Sway, Wayfire) with heavier dependency footprints and less transparent low-level debugging.
- **Verdict**: **X11** is simple, modular, and compatible with our minimal UI target.

---

## 4. Window Manager & Terminal: Fluxbox + xterm

- **Decision**: Select Fluxbox as the window manager and `xterm` as the terminal emulator for Xedra.
- **Reason**: Fluxbox requires negligible RAM (~15-30 MB), has no background daemon dependencies, stores all configurations in clean plain text (`~/.fluxbox/menu`, `~/.fluxbox/init`), and provides a complete windowing environment without desktop portals or policy agents.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - *Full Desktop Environments (GNOME, KDE, Cinnamon, XFCE)*: Pull hundreds of background services, D-Bus daemons, display managers, and megabytes of dependencies.
  - *i3 / bspwm*: Tiling window managers; excellent, but Fluxbox provides traditional floating windows that are immediately intuitive.
- **Verdict**: **Fluxbox + xterm** delivers the smallest reasonably useful graphical desktop.

---

## 5. Build Environment Architecture: Dedicated Debian 13 VM (`xedra-builder`)

- **Decision**: Use a dedicated Debian 13 (Trixie) virtual machine (`xedra-builder`) running on KVM/libvirt as the authoritative build environment for all Xedra distro engineering.
- **Reason**: Distribution engineering tools (`debootstrap`, `live-build`, `losetup`, `mksquashfs`, `xorriso`, `grub-mkstandalone`) require uncompromised Linux kernel privileges (creating real device nodes, loopback devices, and mounting pseudo-filesystems). A dedicated builder VM provides full kernel capabilities safely without granting dangerous `--privileged` root access to containers on the physical host system.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - *Rootless Podman Container*: Evaluated in Stage 2; hit kernel user-namespace limits (`mknod`, nested `mount`).
  - *Privileged Container on Host*: Weakens host security by disabling container isolation mechanisms.
  - *Direct Build on Host*: Pollutes host `/etc/apt/` and package database with cross-distro packages.
- **Verdict**: **Dedicated Debian 13 VM (`xedra-builder`)** is the cleanest, most secure, and most standard approach.

## 6. Testing Environment: Disposable QEMU/KVM Virtual Machine (`xedra-lab`)

- **Decision**: Test the generated Xedra ISOs in a dedicated libvirt VM (`xedra-lab`) configured with 2 vCPUs, 2 GB RAM, and UEFI firmware.
- **Reason**: Testing on virtualized hardware accurately replicates the physical PC boot lifecycle (UEFI firmware $\rightarrow$ GRUB $\rightarrow$ Linux kernel $\rightarrow$ initramfs $\rightarrow$ SysVinit $\rightarrow$ X11 $\rightarrow$ Fluxbox) without risking physical host disks.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - *Host chroot testing*: Cannot test the bootloader, kernel boot, or hardware device initialization.
- **Verdict**: **QEMU/KVM** via `libvirt` provides real hardware virtualization safely.

---

## 7. Licensing & Attribution

- **Decision**: License Xedra's original build tooling and scripts under **GPL-3.0-or-later**, documentation under **CC BY-SA 4.0**, and preserve upstream licenses for all Debian/Linux components.
- **Reason**: Ensures open-source copyleft protection for Xedra tooling while strictly honoring upstream copyright and licensing.

---

## 8. Distribution Delivery & Installation Model

- **Decision**: Package Xedra 0.1 primarily as an ephemeral **Live Hybrid ISO** (squashfs + RAM overlayfs), with permanent disk installer capabilities scheduled for Milestone 0.2+.
- **Reason**: A Live ISO provides immediate, non-destructive testability across virtual and bare-metal environments without disk partitioning risks. The underlying rootfs remains 100% standard and installable to disk via direct UNIX copy or future automated installers (Calamares / `xedra-installer`).
- **Verdict**: **Live ISO First** for Milestone 0.1; **Automated Installers** in Milestones 0.2+.

---

## 9. Declarative Configuration-Driven Build Manifest (Xedra 0.2+ Roadmap)

- **Decision**: Evolve the build pipeline in Milestone 0.2+ to read declarative build manifests (e.g. `config/xedra-build.yaml` or `json`) supporting build profiles (`dev` fast-cache vs `release` full-purge).
- **Reason**: Decouples build parameters (package sets, mirror URLs, cache policies, user credentials, branding) from procedural shell script logic, making builds fully reproducible and configurable without modifying code.
- **Verdict**: **Procedural Scripts** for Milestone 0.1; **Declarative YAML/JSON Manifests** in Milestone 0.2+.
